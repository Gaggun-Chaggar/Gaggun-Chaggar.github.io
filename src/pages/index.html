                    I've known Gaggun for almost 10 years so I can say with
                    absolute certainty that he'd be an asset to any company.
                    He's exceptionally talented, always looking to learn more,
                    and is a patient and supportive mentor. On top of that, he's
                    perceptive, honest, and hilarious. You won't regret hiring
                    him.

                    I worked with Gaggun at Symphony, during this time I have
                    witnessed their exceptional technical knowledge and
                    leadership qualities. Gaggun's ability to communicate
                    complex ideas and mentor junior team members has been
                    invaluable. Beyond their technical expertise, Gaggun brings
                    a positive and adaptable attitude to every challenge. He is
                    dependable, patient and always supportive.
