                experience to 8+ years experience. I conduct bi-weekly 1-2-1s,

                stateless system designs, metrics, structured logging &
                considering multiple instances in software architecture. Working
                with the Platform Engineering team, I have also worked on

              explain a proof of Petr Janˇcar’s regarding said equivalence. The
