            <p>
              When I joined, Symphony Ventures Ltd. (then SYKES Digital
              Services, then Sitel, now Foundever) was a business focused on
              delivering Robotic Process Automation (RPA) solutions as a service
              to a number of clients in various sectors.
            </p>
            <h5>Software Development</h5>
            <p>
              Post onboarding, I was responsible (with one other person) in the
              development of Symphony's first application. This was a Windows
              Desktop (WPF application) which helped implementation consultants
              with the use of RPA tools. After the success of this project, I
              was tasked to build subsequent applications for Symphony's
              internal usage. These include:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ul class="funky-list spacey">
              <li>
                <span
                  >A Desktop Application to help Implementation Consultants:
                </span>
                I can not discuss particulars about this one :). For this
                project, we used C# with a strong lean towards object oriented
                programming and lots of serialisation logic for generating
                structured XML. (I'm not a fan of C# or Object Oriented
                Programming)
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>An 'App/Artefact' Store Framework:</span>
                Symphony had multiple implementation consulting teams
                responsible for technical develivery of solutions using a few
                different tools. In order for these teams to ensure standards
                are met & code is actively reused, I was tasked with building an
                Artefact Storage solution.
                <br />
                This solution allowed users to: View & query a list of reusable
                artefacts, rate artefacts & leave comments, raise bugs & submit
                new artefacts for review (which sent emails with the artefact
                attached).
                <br />
                The solution also had an admin role which allowed administrators
                to upload artefacts & view metrics on download numbers (in
                addition to the above).
                <br />
                <em>Tech Stack:</em> This project was written in TypeScript
                (full stack), with a REST backend, blob storage, NoSQL DB & Vue
                Frontend. The solution also allowed for easy deployments for
                each of the different teams.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Estimation & Project Planning Solution:</span>
                Symphony wanted to streamline the time taken to generate quotes
                for completing projects. This led me to develop and application
                which allowed users to generate project estimates (in days) to
                automate a process based on a process map. The estimates were
                broken down into days for different phases of an implementation,
                this allowed me to also automate the project planning of a
                multi-project estimation, given the number of reasouces.
                <br />
                Using this tool, users were able to quickly generate accurate
                estimations, create project plans, and then quote the total
                number of days and estimated end date of a project.
                <br />
                This solution also had role based access and allowed more senior
                staff to see the estimated cost of the quote.
                <br />
                <em>Tech Stack:</em> This project was written in TypeScript
                (full stack), with a GraphQL backend, blob storage & Vue
                Frontend.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Standards Checking Tools:</span>
                To help automate quality checking of implementation solutions
                for Blue Prism. I created a tool which parsed Blue Prism
                projects (a collection of XML files), created a Directed Graph
                and then performed various checks. Similar to sonar, the
                solution provided information in various categories: bugs,
                linting issues, company standards failures and error handling
                checks. This tool also did some graphical calculations to
                determine certain standards where checked (checking
                intersections between objects based on coordinates & creating
                special edges in the graph to denote the connection).
                <br />
                <em>Tech Stack:</em> This project was written in TypeScript
                (full stack), with a REST backend & Vue Frontend.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Integrations:</span>
                I also created integrations with other services on a few
                occasions.
                <br />
                Firstly, I created an orchestrated process which synced time our
                support team spent on tickets in JIRA to our project management
                tool, MavenLink. This saved our support from having to record
                their time twice & lead to more accurate reporting. This
                solution used Jira webhooks to add timesheet changes to a queue,
                which was then picked up by the process to create/update/delete
                the time entry in MavenLink.
                <br />
                <em>Tech Stack:</em> This project was written in TypeScript
                using a task runner framework to pull from a queue system.
                <br />
                Secondly, I created an dashboard for our Solutions team to view
                a select set of data from SalesForce. This was a cost effictive
                & secure way of providing certain users access to a partial set
                of data from SalesForce. The solution involved syncing data from
                SalesForce to a database, creating a backend to allow flexible
                querying of large data & enabling users to update only an
                allowed list of fields.
                <br />
                <em>Tech Stack:</em> This project was written in TypeScript,
                with a task runner for syncing data & GraphQL backend for
                querying. The frontend was written in Vue.
              </li>
              <li>
                <span>Others:</span>
                In addition to the above, I also developed a few other solutions
                in a variad of languages & frameworks including C#, F#, Svelte &
                React. I enjoyed my time with F#, Svelte & React (sorry C#). The
                main reason for Vue's high utilisation at Symphony was the use
                of
                <a href="https://bootstrap-vue.org/" target="_blank">
                  BootstrapVue </a
                >, which at the time, was the most complete & free
                implementation of baseline components for Bootstrap (the company
                application theme was based on Bootstrap).
              </li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Training</h5>
            <p>
              After 6 months, I was responsible for onboarding & training new
              Associates. During my time at Symphony I supported technical
              training for over 20 employees, both in person and remotely for
              staff abroad (US, Poland). This involved creation of new training
              material, creating standardised feedback forms, creating &
              presenting lessons, one-to-one development meetings & hosting an
              end of training competition.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              From a technical point of view, most of the training I supplied
              was for a tool called
              <a href="https://www.blueprism.com/" target="_blank">
                Blue Prism </a
              >, this is not so relevant to my aims currently, however I did
              have to teach the principles of Object Oriented Programming (Blue
              Prism is Object-ly oriented).
            </p>
            <p>
              However, from a project point of view, I taught staff about the
              software development lifecycle, understanding business processes &
              process mapping and software pre-sales engagement & estimation.
              This has been a valuable skill to carry forward, especially as I
              moved on to line-manage staff past the onboarding phase.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Further on into my time at Symphony, I also taught software
              development to multple staff (whom has little experience prior).
              This included learning basics in backend & frontend development,
              react, vue, javascript, typescript, C# & GraphQL.
