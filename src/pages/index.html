                  Consultant and I was promoted 5 times to my final role of

                    I've known Gaggun for almost 10 years so I can say with
                    absolute certainty that he'd be an asset to any company.
                    He's exceptionally talented, always looking to learn more,
                    and is a patient and supportive mentor. On top of that, he's
                    perceptive, honest, and hilarious. You won't regret hiring
                    him.
