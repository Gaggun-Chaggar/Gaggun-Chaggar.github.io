                and frontend engineers ranging from 2 years experience to 8+
                years experience. I conduct bi-weekly 1-2-1s, track goals,

                systems, metrics, structured logging & designing horizontally
                scalable architecture. I have also worked on creating and
                deploying Helm charts to cloud hosted Kubernetes environments

                contributing to code bases: I complete code reviews for many
                repositiories across my team as well as other teams; I define
                code standards for GoLang and TypeScript within my team & I work

                planning applications, process modelling applications, B2B
                integrations & more. Backends were developed in either C#, F# or
                TypeScript, with REST or GraphQL apis, frontends were developed
                in TypeScript with Vue or React.

              During my time at Warick, I took foward subjects in Algebra,
              Algebraic Graph Theory, Calculus & Analysis, Number & Set Theory,
              Data Structures and Automata, through to my final year.

              My dissertation report is on "DPDA Equalivance", which aimed to
              explain a proof of Petr Janˇcar’s regarding said equivalence. The
              project involved both logical reasoning (explaining theorems &
              writing proofs) & a coding project to model & determine
              equivalence of DPDAs.
